1. I learned so much during this class. I never thought I'd be able to make myself a
website but here I am! I definitely have a
ways to go but I'm proud of all that I learned
and retained. I plan on doctoring up my site over the summer as to not lose what I have learned.  
2. The fonts lesson was really cool to me.
I never really thought about just how important complimentary fonts are in design but they truly make or break a site.
3. I had my fair share of challenges during this course. I managed to overcome them by taking my time and doing a fair amount of outside research.
