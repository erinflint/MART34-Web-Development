<h1>Jamberry</h1>

<p><i>Jamberry</i> was my favorite book as a kid. It follows the berry picking journey of a young boy and his bear friend. They pick countless berries and make all sorts of jams, jellies, pies, tarts, etc. I remember my favorite part of this book being the rhyming schemes. Many used made up words, "trainberry, trackberry, clickety-clackberry", and they were all so fun.</p>
