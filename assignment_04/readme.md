How browsers work: browsers take instructions from a designer's chosen web language (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to display a page's text, graphics, etc. I regularly use Google Chrome.

Markup Languages are used to dictate a page's text content. Languages include HTML, XML and XHTML. HTML is the most commonly used language which uses various tags to identify content and its purposes in respect to the webpage.
