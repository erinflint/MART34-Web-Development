1. I chose to use bootstrap. I had a lot of issues
understanding this week for some reason and I found
the most helpful resources in relation to bootstrap.
2. I used a CDN simply because it made more sense to me. It clicked in my brain far more successfully than using a local file.
3. HTML5 allows for developers to build more diverse
sites and apps for the ever-evolving world of tech.
4. This week was TOUGH. For some reason I couldn't wrap my head around external libraries. I think I
did everything correctly, but honestly I still feel
a little fuzzy about it. I began to treat it as if
it were a stylesheet I wrote and that helped it
click in my head.
