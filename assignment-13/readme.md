1. My imaginary client was myself. I have a little
jewelry making side gig that needed a site so voila!
I knew that I wanted simple yet colorful aesthetics
in my site so that's what I attempted to do.

2. It is important to consider mobile-first designs
because a majority of people access the internet
on their smartphones nowadays. If your site isn't pretty
on a phone/tablet/smaller screen your client won't be
happy!

3. I had some issues with my photos not lining up correctly
but I checked out w3 schools and got it solved! Also, not
a challenge, but I decided to put my drop downs and some
of my checkbox selections on different pages than those
in the assignment. They just worked better with my overall
goal with this site.
