1. My HTML learning experience has been rocky to say the least. My first coding
class always ended in tears. However, the last few that I have taken have been
so much better (thanks so much to your teaching style). I was telling my partner
tonight that this class has come far more easily to me than I ever anticipated.
The only things that have tripped me up have been grasping the purpose of <div>s
and remembering how to structure tables. 
2. I'm always anxious to learn new things in coding. I am pretty excited to
learn how to make my websites actually pretty...and not look like they're out
of 1998.
3. I am proud of myself with how smoothly this week's assignment went. The only
problems I had were just little blips of code being forgotten, but I managed
to figure out where I went wrong pretty quickly. ie: I forgot to write </table>
at the end of my table code and the table showed up at the very bottom of my
page. How did that happen...? Then bingo, I figured it out!
