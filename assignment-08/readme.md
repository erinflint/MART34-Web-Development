divs, classes, ids, spans: a div is used in a block level format and allows for more readability and structural clarity in the code. A span is an inline identifier that groups content that needs organization or styling. A class groups similar types of elements using the same value. IDs are used to identify unique elements in a page.

Youtube and Vimeo make things easy when embedding a video. The steps to do so are short and simple but certain browsers may have issues with loading/playing the video.

This week made sense for the most part. It took a few reads of the <div> page to understand what they are used for, but that was about the only real obstacle I ran into. I'm excited to learn more about styling a page so I can see everything come together!
