   A margin is the space between the border/container and the edge of the page.

2. This week I had a heck of a time trying to figure out why my display-inline wasn't
working. I managed to finish the other requirements for the assignment but my
menu items ended up being stacked on top of each other instead of displayed
side by side and I am not sure why. I'm uploading my assignment as is with hopes
of eventually figuring out my mistake and correcting it.
