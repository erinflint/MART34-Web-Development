      <i>When Rabbit Howls</i> is the only book I am aware of that has been
      written by a victim of child sexual abuse who developed multiple personalities.
      What makes this book especially fascinating is that while it initially
      appears to be written about and by Truddi Chase, it is in actuality the story
      and creation of the many persons who cluster within her.
    </br>
    You will not find here the story of one clearly identifiable person in one body.
    In fact, according to our most current information, Truddi Chase-the "first born"-
    has not been present since she was two years old. She lived in a small recess,
    "asleep", and her place was taken by a succession of persons. This in itself
    creates a dilemma: how to refer to the person or persons whom we meet in these pages?
